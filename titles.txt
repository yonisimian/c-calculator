This is a calculator program.

Write an expression using the next operations: + - * / % ^ !
Write ANS for the value of the last calculation.
You can use the constants E, PI, PHI anytime you'd like.
You can use the functions SIN, COS, TAN, SQRT, LOG, LN, ABS.
You can use 3 manually assigned variables: X, Y, Z.

NOTE: Trigonometric functions are in radians and not degrees.
NOTE: LOG function is in base 10
NOTE: Assign variables by X=[expression], like "X=3PI".

Write HELP to view this message again.
Write HISTORY to view the calculation history.
Write QUIT to quit the program.

The program is case-insensitive, so SIN = sin, PI = pi etc.
The program is space-insensitive, use them freely (appropriatly).

Enjoy!
